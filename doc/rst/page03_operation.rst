Operating LEDI
==============

By default, LEDI will go into a clock mode. In this mode, it will display the
"current" time. LEDI will only keep track of time when it's powered up, so you
will see "00:00" on the clock. In addition to HH:MM clock digits, you will see
the binary second ticker on the right.

There are 3 buttons on the board.

* 1st button resets the device
* 2nd button puts LEDI into a cool Game-of-Life display mode
* 3rd button allows you to set the time
  - short press for incrementing one minute at a time
  - long press for fast-forwarding time
