0x03 Operating LEDI
===================

When it's first powered up, LEDI will go into a clock mode. The clock starts
at "00:00", since LEDI does not keep track of time when it's powered off.
However, once powered on it will constantly keep accurate time across various
operating modes.

Also in addition to HH:MM clock digits, you will see the binary indicator ticking
every second. 


Tactile Buttons
---------------

There are 3 buttons on the board.

* 1st button resets the device
* 2nd button puts LEDI into Conway's Game-of-Life display mode
* 3rd button allows you to set the time
  - short press for incrementing one minute at a time
  - long press for fast-forwarding time



Bluetooth Communication
-----------------------

Everytime LEDI is reset, the bluetooth module will put it into discoverable mode.
Other bluetooth devices can easily scan and pair with LEDI. 


Bonding
~~~~~~~
Let's first "bond" with LEDI using an Android phone. Go to::

  Settings -> Wireless Settings -> Bluetooth Settings


Android Apps
~~~~~~~~~~~~
We are currently working on making a customized Android app for LEDI. In the meantime,
there are slew of available Android Apps that just works with LEDI. Almost all of them are
free. For example, I've tested:

* SENA_ BTerm Bluetooth Terminal 
* BlueTerm_

Your LEDI uses Bluetooth module that understands SPP (Serial Port Profile). What this
basically means is that it's compatible with lots of bluetooth-enabled software out there.

We have interesting set of features planned for our Android App:

* Virtual LEDI face that will give you the ability to light up individual led
* Notification forwarding (email, sms, text msg, etc..)
* Automatic clock time setting

We also welcome open source contributions! If you have ideas and would like to help writing
the Android app, please `contact us <http://techversat.com/about-us/contact-us/>`_!


Talk to It
~~~~~~~~~~
Let's try downloading BlueTerm_ from the App store on your phone. I found it to be the 
simplest one to use when I was testing LEDI.

#. Open the App
#. Hit settings button on your phone
#. Tap "Connect device"
#. Tap "Scan for devices"
#. Your LEDI will show up as one of the devices as "linvor" or "LEDI_XXX"
#. It will say "Connected to <your_device>"
#. Type something on the terminal
#. Hit "enter" on your virtual keyboard

Hopefully, you will see the message you just typed scroll across LEDI.


Power Supply
------------

The power circuit gives you options. Sometimes options are good, but sometimes they can be confusing.
Hopefully the DC power circuit in LEDI can prove to be the prior. We've taken the power schematics 
from Sparkfun_'s breadboard power supply.

This power circuit provides clean 5v or 3.3v DC. You can source power from an external battery through
the connector shown in the picture:

Or you can supply regulated power to other circuits through these pins on the PCB:

For example, I am powering the Arduino via the power output pins:
