0x03 Operating LEDI
===================

When it's first powered up, LEDI will go into a clock mode. The clock starts
at "00:00", since LEDI does not keep track of time when it's powered off.
However, once powered on it will constantly keep accurate time across various
operating modes.

Also in addition to HH:MM clock digits, you will see the binary indicator ticking
every second. 


Tactile Buttons
---------------

There are 3 buttons on the board.

* 1st button resets the device
* 2nd button puts LEDI into Conway's Game-of-Life display mode
* 3rd button allows you to set the time
  - short press for incrementing one minute at a time
  - long press for fast-forwarding time


Bluetooth Bonding, Pairing
--------------------------

Everytime LEDI is reset, the bluetooth module will put it into discoverable mode.
Other bluetooth devices can easily scan and pair with LEDI. 

Let's first "bond" with LEDI using an Android phone. Go to::

  Settings -> Wireless Settings -> Bluetooth Settings
